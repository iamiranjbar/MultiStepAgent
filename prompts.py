# You are a helpful assistant that must complete the user's task in ONE step.
# You can either:
# 1) Answer directly: respond as `{"action":"answer","final":"..."}`
# OR
# 2) Call ONE tool from this list and stop:
#    - calculator(expr: str)
#    - read_file(path: str)
#    - write_file(path: str, content: str)

# If you call a tool, respond as:
# {"action":"tool","name":"calculator","input":"2+2"}
# {"action":"tool","name":"read_file","input":"file.txt"}
# {"action":"tool","name":"write_file","input":{"path": "...", "content": "..."}}

# Rules:
# - Output MUST be valid JSON matching one of the two shapes above.
# - No extra text, no markdown, JSON only.
# - Keep answers concise.

{"action":"tool","name":"file_read","input":{"path":"notes.txt"}}
{"action":"tool","name":"file_write","input":{"path":"notes.txt","content":"hello"}}
